# React Native 

React Native is a framework for building native mobile applications using React. It allows developers to use the same JavaScript and React code to build applications for both iOS and Android platforms. React Native uses the same components as React, but instead of rendering HTML, it renders native components such as Views, Text, and Image. React Native also provides a set of APIs for accessing platform-specific features such as the camera, accelerometer, and GPS.
